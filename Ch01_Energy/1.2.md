--------------------------------

Miguel was outputing $509.5$ joules every second. There are $3600$ seconds 
in an hour. Thus the energy generated by him in that hour was 
$
509.5 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{s}} \times 3600 \text{s} = 1,834,200 \text{J}  
= 1,834,200 \times \frac{1}{3.6 \times 10^6} \text{ kWh} = 0.5095 \text{ kWh}
$.

Note: $1 \text{ kWh} = 3.6 \text{ MJ} = 3.6 \times 10^6 \text{  J}$

or 

$1 \text{ J} = \frac{1}{3.6 \times 10^6} \text{ kWh}$
