Answer: B. 49 %. 

The way to convert fossil fuels into electrical energy is as follows: 

1. Convert the **chemical energy** stored in fossil fuels to **thermal energy**, 
by burning. This has an efficiency of about $90 \%$.

2. Using heat engines, **thermal energy** can be converted into **mechanical energy**.
Heat engines have a conversion efficiency of up to $60 \%$. Their efficiency is 
ulitimately limited by the Carnot efficiency limit.

3. **Mechanical energy** can be converted into **electricity** using electric 
generators with an efficiency of $90 \%$ or even higher. 

Thus, 

$$
\frac{90}{100} \times \frac{60}{100} \times \frac{90}{100} = \frac{486000}{10^6} = 48.6 \%
$$
